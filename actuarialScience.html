        <h1>Applied Math: Actuarial Science Concentration</h1>
        <div class="mainText">
            <p>The Department of Mathematics provides training in mathematics and its applications to solve problems in business, engineering, 
                the social sciences, and other disciplines. The curriculum offers a blend of pure mathematics and its applications. The department 
                offers opportunities for students to grow their passion for mathematics and enrich their understanding of its role in the world 
                through participation in conferences, community teaching, undergraduate research, and clubs. Majors are well prepared for positions 
                in industry, government, and education, as well as for graduate studies.

                All majors must take a senior comprehensive (MATH 496 or MATH 499) in the fall semester of their final year.
                Prospective teachers of mathematics should consult the School of Education for the current state certification requirements.
                
                It is recommended that all Mathematics majors take PHYS 103, CHEM 101, or BIOL 105 to satisfy their University Core Scientific Inquiry 
                requirement. The department involves students with activities sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the Society 
                of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). Majors may also participate in the annual William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition 
                held every December.
                
                Students pursuing a major in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics cannot pursue a minor in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics. Students 
                are able to major or minor in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics, but not both.
